                Life is alright in Devil's Maw, for now at least. Welcome to the slums of the former city of Pensacola, Florida. Starvation now twists societies until they break. The United States is now nothing but a dissolved, large country without a name or purpose. Millions have starved as their leaders scramble to useless meetings with other wastelands. 
              </p>
              <p>
                A boy would run down a dank and dirty alley, avoiding various bonfires and people as he ran for home. The alley was home to over 200 people who have been unfortunate enough to not perish from starvation. The people built their homes from scrap metal and torn apart suburban homes, with many of them hanging from the sides of buildings.

              <p>
                Rubio cleared the small table in his mother's hut and splayed out the rations he amassed from his raids. He often found himself wandering farther and farther from his "village" due to how scarce food was. He and his mother had food for only the next two days if he'd share his findings with his people. Anxiety would prick in his hands as he had a decision to make, one too immense for a 7-year-old. He'd jump in surprise as his mom's voice would appear behind him.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Good find. The village will eat well tonight." Her hands would clasp on his shoulders as if she knew the weight of his thoughts. He'd sigh and take their share of food from the pile before packing the rest for the village. He'd stare at the 6 cans of soup for the two of them as he heard his mother exit their hut. His hands spoke for the growing pit in his stomach as one reached for a can. He'd tear himself away from it last second, scolding himself for attempting such.
              </p>
              <p>
                Days and nights wore on until an aircraft cut through the alley's atmosphere like a knife. Men in large, exoskeleton-like suits stepped out of the vehicle. A crowd swarmed them as he and his mother ate in their home, watching the group from afar. The men in the village challenged the strangers, causing the air to grow somehow thicker. One man soon got physical with one of the foreigners and shoved him back. This caused the others to remove cylinders with odd patterns from their belts. One would click a red button on the side of the contraption to reveal a contracting hard-light spear. He'd shove it into the man who caused the conflict, splitting his chest open and neutralizing him. The fight was on as Rubio watched his mom close the curtain to their home and scoot him towards the back. He'd watch as she would open their patchwork fireplace like a door and climb inside, grabbing him by the arm. This was one of his fathers hiding holes.
              </p>
              <p>
                His father was a strange man, to say the least. He was paranoid and often found ways to install secret spaces and exits into their homes. He also looked like an exact clone of his ancestors, as did Rubio. Nobody knew where he had gone, nor did they wish to look for him. The lawless land was harsh, to say the least. Many people perished outside Devil's Maw due to the elements or their own species. Hell, people perished inside of Devil's Maw for the same reasons. Rubio would begin to step into the hiding hole before feeling his arm popping out of its socket. He’d hear a scream from his mother as a ripping pain would spread from his shoulder. 
              </p>
              <p>
                “You’re coming with me.” barked the man as he continued to pull Rubio's arm, causing him to yell out as pain ripped down his arm. He'd watch as his mother would jump out of his fathers hiding hole with a stone. Before she could take a proper swing and the man, he would flip on his spear, causing it to contract into her right eye.
              </p>
              <p>
                "No!" screamed Rubio as he watched his mother fall back into the hole. He'd struggle to free himself from the mans grip, however this would cause him to have his arm pulled even more. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Now outside, Rubio cried as he lined up with the other boys who lived in the alley way. The men inspected them before grouping themselves away from the line. Feeling his teeth grit from him clenching his jaw, Rubio would slide his blade out of its sheath. He'd feel rage wreck his reasoning as he would fling it at the man who had stabbed his mother, hitting him in the neck. He'd watch the man immediately fall to the ground, figuring he must have hit his spinal cord. The group of men stared at the body, then him, then back at the body, then at each other. A few murmurs would exchange between the men before one would remove the knife from the fallen mans neck. He'd walk over to Rubio and hold the knife out with the handle facing towards him. 
              </p>
              <p>
                "Come with me, I'll get you and your family something to eat and we can have a chat." He'd say, removing the mask he was wearing. Rubio would stare at the greying man and take his knife. He'd nod and the man would grab him by the hand and lead him to walk in front of him. Rubio would flinch as the sound of gun fire would ring through the alley. He'd attempt to look back but would have his head turned by the man behind him.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Don't worry about that now, let's go get you some food. What would you like to eat?"
